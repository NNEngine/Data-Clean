**Problem**

> In every *machine learning workflow*, **data cleaning** is one of the most time-consuming and repetitive tasks. 
  Yet, as ML engineers, our true focus should be on building models, crafting architectures, and solving real problems - not spending endless hours handling missing values, formatting inconsistencies and      unwanted noise in CSV files.    

**Solution**
> That's exactly why I build this **CSV Data Cleaning App**. This tool helps you *clean your data* in few steps. All you need to do is to click on the button the operation you want to apply on the file.   After applying all the operations, you can download the final cleaned CSV File.
